Stocks, also called equities, represent partial ownership in a company. When you own stock, you have a claim to a portion of the company’s assets and earnings based on how many shares you hold. These shares serve as proof of ownership and can be bought or sold on the market.

Stock prices constantly fluctuate due to market forces, primarily supply and demand. If more people are interested in purchasing a stock than selling it, the price will rise. Conversely, if more people are selling than buying, the price will drop. This basic principle of supply and demand explains price movements, but predicting stock price changes remains a challenge. Some argue that price shifts are unpredictable, while others believe historical trends and technical analysis can provide insights into when to buy or sell.

What’s certain is that stocks are highly volatile, meaning their prices can change rapidly and unexpectedly.
